# TOP: Etch-A-Sketch

After a deep research about the project, I did find that most of the user where using it Grid instead of Flex as it is supposed to be easier.

As I am following The Odin Project Curriculum, grid is something that at the moment of coding Etch-A-Sketch, we haven't learnt yet. So I decided to make it work with Flex.

At a first try, I did create the board all in once, but when working on the event to change the color when the mouse enter the board. I couldn't find a way of make it work.

I was lucky to find someones comment on reddit where they did suggest to work vertically, in other words create one column and the using loops to develop the others. Everything started working after this.

I was also struggling a little bit with Arrays, so at first chance I did make loops in order to change the colour and clear the grid. But after some very long research and practice. I manage to understand better the Array.from and forEach methods.

Hope that will help to anyone trying to work using flex.
